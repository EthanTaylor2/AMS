# Test AMS model on valid dataset

After training step, we can use the trained model to predict the result on valid dataset.

See our own trained model:  [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hrZxSiS)

## How to run the code
1. Use Apparance model to predict the result on test dataset. More details can be found in ./Appearance
2. Use Motion model to predict the result on test dataset. More details can be found in ./Motion
3. Use Skeleton model to predict the result on test dataset. More details can be found in ./Skeleton
4. Fusion these three models' result. More details can be found in ./Fusion
